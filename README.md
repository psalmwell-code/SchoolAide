# Data Collection
The data sets used was gotten from a google form survey. The data sets were in form of a spreadsheet that was updated as it was being filled and linked to a data visualization tool.
# Data Cleaning
The data sets from the googlesheet were linked to PowerBI by publishing a web URL from the googlesheet and copied to the “get data from web” feature on PowerBI. 
Power query was used to transform the data sets by promoting headers, deleting empty rows and checking the consistency of the data sets.
A new column name was also given to make the columns easier to work with.

# Insights and Recommendations
Averagely, more than 90% of the responses use the internet for study aids. This shows that the schoolaide product can be internet based.
The most common type of study aid among students were: past questions, YouTube videos, solution manuals, tutorial and texts. We can infer that audiovisual method of teaching and precise texts with solutions is recommended.
About 92% of the responses find the use of problem-solving website helpful. This reinforce the deduction mentioned above that schoolaide can be online with ready made solutions.
A form of storage is needed by most students to access materials they need. It was noted that students prefer a storage system that does not take up space on their device. Hence, google drive and hardcopy texts are preferred. I will recommend a cloud-based library where students can keep downloaded study aids.
A higher percentage of student spend “less than 10k” and “10k to 20k” for study aids which correlates with the ideal amount to be spent on study aids but the 50th percentile of ideal amount to be spent is between 10k to 20k.
The price influence on study aids remains almost neutral based on the data collected so far.
I will recommend a basic level and pro level for the product users to accommodate more users since a higher percentage expect an amount “less than 10k” which is less than the median value.
